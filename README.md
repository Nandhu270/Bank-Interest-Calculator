A Java-based program to calculate the interest on bank deposits and loans. This project demonstrates basic Java concepts, including user input, conditionals, and mathematical operations.

---

## Features

- Calculates **Simple Interest (SI)** and **Compound Interest (CI)**.
- User-friendly console-based interface.
- Flexible input for principal, rate of interest, and time.
- Validates user inputs for accuracy.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java** for development.
- **Eclipse/IntelliJ** (or any IDE) for development (optional).

---

## Formulae Used

### Simple Interest (SI)
SI = P×R×T/100
- **P**: Principal amount
- **R**: Rate of interest (per annum)
- **T**: Time (in years)

### Compound Interest (CI)
CI = p*(1+R/100)^T-P
- **P**: Principal amount
- **R**: Rate of interest (per annum)
- **T**: Time (in years)
