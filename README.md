## Formulae Used

### Simple Interest (SI)
\[ SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]
- **P**: Principal amount
- **R**: Rate of interest (per annum)
- **T**: Time (in years)

### Compound Interest (CI)
\[ CI = P \times \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T - P \]
- **P**: Principal amount
- **R**: Rate of interest (per annum)
- **T**: Time (in years)
